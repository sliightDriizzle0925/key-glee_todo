          Feel free to alter or delete any of the code present in this
          next.js/react app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively you may use whatever frontend tools you feel more
          comfortable with!

        <p>
          Create a basic TODO app using the provided backend. You shouldn&apos;t
          need to alter the backend, just worry about making the proper CRUD api
          calls to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The backend and templated frontend are set up for being a simple TODO list app,
          but feel free to come up with your own theme! Your frontend could say something like 
          &ldquo;Shopping List&ldquo; and the frontend elements could reflect that theme! Have fun and be creative!
        </p>
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Functionality to read the current TODOs from the API</li>
          <li>
            Functionality to create new TODOs from the frontend to the API
          </li>
          <li>Show off your coding style!</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Optional</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Functionality to update existing TODOs</li>
          <li>Functionality to delete existing TODOs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Try to limit yourself to no more than 2 hours. We really don&apos;t
          want you spending all your free time working on this.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">The Frontend</h3>
        <p>
          The frontend provided is a starter for a react/next.js app. Feel free
          to build off of this or totally remove everything in `todo-demo` to
          make your own app using the tools of your choice.
        </p>

        <h4>Tools being used by the Starter Template</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Next.js</li>
          <li>React.js</li>
          <li>Tailwindcss</li>
          <li>Typescript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Tailwindcss is currently disabled via the globals.css file, feel free
          to re-enable it.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">The Backend</h3>
        <p>
          The backend is a simple REST API that you can interact with via API
          calls from your frontend. By default the backend&apos;s base url will
          be `http://localhost:4000` with additional routes for the resource
          type itself (for example: GET `http://localhost:4000/todos` will get
          all todos).
        </p>
        <p>
          Additional API routes and documentation is provided in the
          repository&apos;s README.
